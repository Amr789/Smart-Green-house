# Smart-Green-house
Developed a specialized adaptive lighting system tailored for greenhouse environments,
integrating a Timet 6000 light intensity sensor within a discreet cover and an MDF
enclosure for aesthetic consistency. The system's mechanism, including a motor, PVC pipes
with attached PVC sheets, and ball bearing endings, dynamically regulates light exposure.
Incorporated within the window assembly, the Timet 6000 sensor, an Arduino
microcontroller, MDF structure, and acrylic sheet collectively optimize light intake.
Supported by a sturdy base, this innovative setup caters to greenhouse agriculture,
enabling precise control of indoor lighting conditions to enhance plant growth and
optimize agricultural productivity.
